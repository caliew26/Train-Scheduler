# Train-Scheduler

This is a great way to schedule a train departure.

When you land on the page you'll see a table of scheduled trains, if you'd like to add a train to the schedule please fill out all 4 fields of the form.  The next departure time should be military time (ie 0800 or 2000).

The next depature time will update with the next train departure once the time has come.

The page will refresh automatically for you.
